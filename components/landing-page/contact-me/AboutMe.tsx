      <p>
        Born in Toronto, raised in Hong Kong. I believe that to succeed in this
        industry, one must always be learning and adapting quickly. In my spare
        time, I like to lift heavy objects and put them down repetitively in a
        small room with people of similar interests. Oh, I also rollerblade and
        play games. Currently, I am learning to digitally draw.

        A fun fact about me is that in 2018 I paddled in the Club Crews World
        Championship for my Dragonboat team (not to be confused with
        DragonballZ) in Hungary and our team received eight gold medals.
